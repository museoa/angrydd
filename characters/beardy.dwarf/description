Beardy Axebeard
Height: 118cm
Beard: 127cm
Five-time winner of the Mr. Dwarf contest, Beardy is the paragon of dwarfliness. His beard is an unsurpassed waterfall of earth-brown curls, his mustache soars like the jowls of a walrus, and his thews are indeed mighty. Despite this, his first entry into the world of drunkenly dropping rocks on other dwarves wasn't until the Hamlysham Incident of '67. Although little is said and less is repeated of this horrifying event, the effect that it had on Axebeard is stunning. He immediately quit his job as a hammersmith and ale merchant and turned to the back-cavern games of the disenfranchised youth. Although he has been involved in drunken rock-dropping for a third of the time some of the veterans have, he has shown himself to be a serious contender.
