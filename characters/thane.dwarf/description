Thane Coalhoarder
Height: 141cm

Nobody would ever believe in a dwarven pirate. Not in these times of cookie-cutter battleragers and law-minded defenders. That's why Thane is from the future. He's the meanest, sword-slingin'ist, gun-totin'ist dwarf this side of the galactic core. He's not too fond about being stuck in the past though, so he's taking it out on everyone around him.
