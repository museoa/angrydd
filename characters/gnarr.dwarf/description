Some dwarves are born with the warrior's spirit, and others steal the honor from more worthy combatants in the confusion of battle. Gnarr is a proud member of the second camp, earning his high rank in the dwarven army by bashing his larger opponents in the kneecaps and scurrying away. The large epaulets prove it. He enjoys shouting at strangers and bashing things.
