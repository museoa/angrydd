Hpmh. It's a good thing that punks like you aren't allowed in the army. Do some fetch quests. Kill some rats. Get a cave. Start a family. Just don't come back until you can lift that helmet of yours.
Hah! This reminds me of the Elfgate War of '39. Me and the boys got smashing drunk and were dropping boulders on the ponce-ears like Samuel Stronginthearms, your uncle. Only then it was a todger of a challenge.
Hrmph. You youngsters got no grit. Try again after another century.
