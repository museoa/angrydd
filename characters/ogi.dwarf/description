Ogi Hammeraxe
Height: 122cm
Beard: 75cm
Famed founder of the Hammeraxe School of Hammer and Axe Fighting, Ogi is one bad dude. He once punched this other dwarf in the face just for laughing after he accidentally rhymed while explaining the function of a hammer. When he is not bashing and verbally berating others, he spends his time pushing rocks around and drinkin'. As such, he is a prime candidate for being an angry and drunken dwarf.
