Tharl Rockpuncher
Height: 101cm
Beard: 33cm
Tharl never wanted to be an angry, drunken dwarf, but circumstances beyond his control have pushed him to become one of the best in the field.  When he was just a wee fat 'un, Tharl went on a quest of adventurous proportions. Along the way, he was cursed by an evil wizard to slowly transform into an elf unless he abandoned his muffin-eating ways and turned to pushing rocks upon the heads of others. Now a tragic reflection of his former self, Tharl goes through his days in a drunken haze, swearing revenge against the wizard who kept him from his true, muffiny love.
