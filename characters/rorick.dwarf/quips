Clan Granitespire: Turning big, fat dwarves into little, flat dwarves for twenty beers!
Chip your armor, bash your pate! Crack your axe and steal your shield! That's what other dwarveses hate!
Kick them, beat them, and they yield.
I've eaten rabbits that were heftier than you. Get lost or fetch me a meatpie.
Gfah hah hah! Is it munchtime already?
