Rorick Granitespire
Height: 98cm
Beard: 56cm
Ever since the dawn of time, the dwarves of clan Granitespire have had but one goal: To become largest and wealthiest dwarves in the world. They have tried many methods throughout the ages, but Rorick's stands to be the most likely to work. He has decided that the best way to become very, very large is to make all of the other dwarves very, very small. This is best accomplished with large quantities of rocks and ale.
