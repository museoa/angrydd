Bodger Hearthsplitter
Height: 129cm
Beard: 73cm
Bodger is living proof that one should make deals with genies. He found one years ago, and quickly became the owner of the world. He's rich and there's no moral or disappointing side-effects. The only problem that exists is slight. You see, nobody recognizes his ownership, and have even found the audacity to laugh at Sir Hearthsplitter the King (as he styles himself) for his claims. Never one to give up, Bodger has decided that the best way for others to recognize his claims is to be made flat.
